# Schedule_class
This is the most complicated project I've created so far. This is a Python program that I'm using to schedule timetables for my class using the Genetic Algorithm.

By working on this project, you can learn how to build and manage classes, libraries - a part of object-oriented programming, 
while also learning how to utilize Genetic Algorithm - a super simple and useful algorithm to generate the optimal solution for a given problem
