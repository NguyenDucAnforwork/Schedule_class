# Schedule_class
The most complicated project I've created so far. This is a Python program that I'm using to schedule timetables for my class using the Genetic Algorithm.

By working on this project, you can learn how to build and manage classes, libraries - a part of object-oriented programming, 
while also learning how to utilize Genetic Algorithm - a super simple and useful algorithm to generate the optimal solution for a given problem

in the Classes.py file: All the class needed for this funciton 

First, I encode the classes, professors, and student groups into binary code (also known as one-hot encoding) for the convenience of subsequent steps (mutation and crossover) (where I use a small but useful technique that you can explore further on your own). 

Then, I construct basic functions to implement the algorithm, including init_population, mutate, crossover, fitness function, and so on.
